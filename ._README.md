I designed and simulated a register using a dffe, register, decoders, tristate buffers and AND gates

regfile: 
My design was implemented by having a decoder which takes in the 5 bit ctrl write reg signal and produces 32 output wires, each sent to an AND gate with the ctrl bit. The output of the AND gate goes in to the enable of the register. The data write reg goes into the data port for the register, the register also takes a clock signal and reset bit and outputs the data on port q. The data (q) gets set to the tri-state buffer, whose enable is a bit from a decoder. This decoders input is a 5 bit ctrl read reg A (for one decoder) and a 5 bit ctrl read reg B (for another decoder). The output of the tri-state buffer is 32 bit data which gets sent to a wire and when the enable is high the output gets sent to data read reg A or data read reg B respectively, but when the data is low the output is  32'bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.

tristate buffer:
for the tristate buffer I used the assign statement, and it is used in my regfile.v 

assign out_data_regB[31:0] = enb_32[31] ? out_q31[31:0] : 32'bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz; 

for each output value out_q0[31:0] to out_q31[31:0] 

decoder_5_32:
I designed a 5:32 decoder using 32 and gates and I use the inverse input of each of the 5 bits. 

register:
In my register file I created 32 dffe instances with the input to the dffe being [31:0] data, clk, enable, clear/reset bit and the output being [31:0] on variable q.

After my testing I am not getting any bugs or issues with my design
