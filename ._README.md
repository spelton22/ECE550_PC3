In PC4 we designed a simple processor which handles add, addi, sub, and, or, sll, sra, sw, and lw instructions.

We used a PC, an ALU to increment the PC count, instruction memory, a register file, an ALU, data memory, and a couple of muxes. 

--MODULES--

Skeleton: We used the provided code from the project on canvas.

Regfile: We used the provided code from the project on canvas.

Processor: The driving module of the processor we have created. It instantiates the control signals, PC, and the ALU. It also sets the address_imem, address_dmem, data, wren, ctrl_writeEnable, ctrl_writeReg, ctrl_readRegA, ctrl_readRegB, and data_writeReg. 

DMEM: This was generated through Quartus from the steps on canvas.
  
IMEM: This was generated through Quartus from the steps on canvas.

ALU: We used the provided code from the project on canvas.

Control: We take the instruction and ALU opcode as inputs and use and statements to set which instruction we are using, rtype, add, sub, addi, sw, lw, which are outputs.

DFFE: We used code that was given to us from a previous assignment for this class.

Clock Divider: We used the link provided in the PC 4 assignment to create our divide by 4 clock divider module.

PC: Creates a single 12 bit register to keep track of the program counter

Register: Amelia's previous code from a PC to create 1, 32 bit register 

We believe this implementation is correct!
